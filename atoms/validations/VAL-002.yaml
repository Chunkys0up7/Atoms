  # Database Backup/Recovery Validation

  ## Backup Validation Tests
  - [ ] Backup file integrity (checksum verification)
  - [ ] Backup completeness (row count matches)
  - [ ] Backup compression ratio within expected range
  - [ ] Backup upload to S3 successful
  - [ ] Backup encryption verified

  ## Restore Validation Tests
  - [ ] Full restore from latest backup
  - [ ] Point-in-time recovery (PITR) to specific timestamp
  - [ ] Restore to alternate database instance
  - [ ] Data integrity checks post-restore
  - [ ] Relationship integrity verified

  ## Recovery Time Testing
  - Target RTO: < 4 hours
  - Target RPO: < 6 hours
  - Measured restore time for 100GB database
  - Measured restore time for 1TB database

  ## Automated Weekly Tests
  - Restore latest backup to test environment
  - Run data integrity queries
  - Verify constraint violations: 0
  - Verify foreign key integrity: pass
