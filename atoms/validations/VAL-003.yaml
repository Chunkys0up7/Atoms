title: API Gateway Testing and Load Validation
summary: Test plan for REST and GraphQL APIs including functional, performance, and security testing
content: |
  # API Gateway Test Plan

  ## Functional Tests (REST)
  - GET /api/v1/atoms - List atoms with pagination
  - GET /api/v1/atoms/{id} - Get single atom
  - POST /api/v1/atoms - Create atom
  - PUT /api/v1/atoms/{id} - Update atom
  - DELETE /api/v1/atoms/{id} - Delete atom
  - Error handling (404, 422, 500)
  - HATEOAS links validation

  ## Functional Tests (GraphQL)
  - Simple queries (atom by ID)
  - Complex queries (nested relationships)
  - Mutations (create, update, delete)
  - Subscriptions (real-time updates)
  - Query complexity limiting
  - Error handling and partial responses

  ## Performance Tests
  - Load test: 10,000 req/s sustained for 10 minutes
  - Stress test: Increase to failure point
  - Response time p95: < 200ms
  - Response time p99: < 500ms
  - Connection pool utilization < 80%

  ## Security Tests
  - Authentication bypass attempts
  - Authorization checks (RBAC)
  - Rate limiting enforcement
  - SQL injection in query parameters
  - GraphQL injection attempts
  - Excessive query depth blocking

  ## API Contract Tests
  - OpenAPI spec compliance
  - GraphQL schema validation
  - Breaking change detection
  - Backward compatibility verification
