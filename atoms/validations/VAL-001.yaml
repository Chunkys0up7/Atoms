  # Authentication System Test Plan

  ## Unit Tests
  - Password hashing and verification
  - JWT token generation and validation
  - TOTP generation and verification
  - Rate limiting logic
  - Session management

  ## Integration Tests
  - OAuth flow end-to-end (Google, GitHub, Microsoft)

  - XSS attempts in login forms
  - CSRF token validation
  - Brute force protection
  - Session fixation attacks
  - JWT signature verification

  ## Performance Tests
  - Login endpoint: 1000 req/s sustained
  - Token validation: < 5ms p95
  - OAuth callback: < 500ms p95

  ## Test Coverage Target
  - Code coverage: > 85%
  - Branch coverage: > 80%
  - Critical paths: 100%
