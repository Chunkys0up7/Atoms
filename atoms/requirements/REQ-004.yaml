title: Graph Database Integration for Knowledge Management
summary: Integrate Neo4j graph database for storing and querying knowledge graph with atoms, modules, and relationships
content: |
  The system shall provide graph database capabilities for the GNDP knowledge graph:

  ## Graph Data Model
  - Nodes: Atom entities with type, metadata, and content
  - Relationships: DEPENDS_ON, IMPLEMENTS, VALIDATES, RISKS
  - Properties: All YAML metadata fields stored as node properties

  ## Query Capabilities
  - Downstream impact analysis via graph traversal
  - Shortest path algorithms for dependency chains
  - Cycle detection for circular dependencies
  - Pattern matching for architectural queries

  ## Integration Points
  - Bidirectional sync with YAML source files
  - Scheduled synchronization every 24 hours
  - On-demand sync triggered by PR merges
  - Version history tracking for atom changes

  ## Performance
  - Query response time < 200ms for up to 10,000 nodes
  - Support for concurrent read queries
  - Write batching for bulk updates

  ## Security
  - Role-based access control (RBAC)
  - Read-only access for CI/CD pipeline
  - Write access restricted to sync processes
