  summary: Customer uploads W-2 forms for income verification as part of the loan
    application process
  description: The W-2 upload process is a critical step in income verification for
    salaried employees. Customers receive a document request through the loan portal
    or email, prompting them to upload their most recent W-2 forms (typically the
    two most recent tax years). W-2 forms provide official documentation of wages,
    tips, and other compensation reported to the IRS, making them a primary source
    of income verification. The system accepts various file formats (PDF, JPG, PNG)
    and performs basic validation to ensure the document is readable and appears to
    be a W-2 form. This process is essential for verifying the income stated on the
    loan application and calculating qualifying income.
  steps:
  - Customer receives document request notification via email or loan portal
  - Customer logs into secure loan portal
  - Customer navigates to document upload section
  - Customer selects 'W-2 Form' from document type dropdown
  - Customer selects tax year (e.g., 2023, 2022)
  - Customer clicks 'Choose File' and selects W-2 PDF or image from their device
  - System validates file format (PDF, JPG, PNG accepted)
  - System performs basic image quality check (not blurry, readable)
  - System extracts basic data from W-2 using OCR (if available)
  - System stores document in secure document management system
  - System updates loan file status to show W-2 received
  - Customer receives confirmation that document was successfully uploaded
  - System notifies processor that new document is available for review
  purpose: Obtain official income documentation from customers to verify stated income
    on the loan application. W-2 forms are required for salaried employees and provide
    IRS-verified income data that is critical for underwriting decisions.
  business_context: W-2 uploads are one of the most common document requests in mortgage
    processing. The process must be user-friendly and secure, as customers are handling
    sensitive tax documents. The bank must comply with data security regulations (including
    IRS requirements for handling tax documents) and ensure documents are stored securely.
    Delays in W-2 uploads are a common cause of loan processing delays, so the system
    must make it easy for customers to upload documents and provide clear feedback
    on document status.

  regulatory_context: W-2 forms contain sensitive tax information protected under

    access controls, and retention policies compliant with IRS requirements. Documents
    must be retained for the required period (typically 7 years) and securely destroyed
    when no longer needed.
