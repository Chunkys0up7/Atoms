  summary: Customer initiates pre-qualification through online portal or phone call
    to determine initial loan eligibility
  description: The pre-qualification request is the first step in the home lending
    journey where a prospective borrower expresses interest in obtaining a mortgage
    loan. This process allows customers to understand their borrowing capacity before
    committing to a full application. The bank uses this opportunity to capture initial
    customer information, assess basic eligibility, and provide a preliminary loan
    amount estimate. This is a non-binding process that helps customers shop for homes
    within their price range and gives the bank an early view of potential loan volume.
  steps:
  - Customer accesses pre-qualification portal via bank website or mobile app
  - 'Customer provides basic information including: full name, contact information,
    employment status, estimated annual income, estimated monthly debts, desired loan
    amount, and property type'
  - Customer consents to soft credit inquiry (does not impact credit score)
  - System validates input data format and completeness
  - System creates pre-qualification request record in LOS
  - Customer receives confirmation email with request ID
  purpose: Enable customers to quickly assess their mortgage eligibility and obtain
    a preliminary loan amount estimate without the commitment of a full application.
    This improves customer experience by providing transparency early in the process
    and helps the bank identify qualified leads.
  business_context: Pre-qualification is a critical customer acquisition tool in competitive
    mortgage markets. It allows the bank to engage customers early, build trust, and
    position themselves as the preferred lender. The process must be fast (typically
    under 24 hours) and user-friendly to compete with digital-first lenders. Pre-qualification
    letters are often required by real estate agents before showing properties, making
    this a gatekeeper process.
