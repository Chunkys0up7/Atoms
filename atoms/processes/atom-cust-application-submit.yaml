  summary: Customer completes and submits Uniform Residential Loan Application (1003)
    to formally apply for a mortgage loan
  description: The loan application submission is the formal initiation of the mortgage
    process where a customer completes the Uniform Residential Loan Application (Form
    1003), the standard form used by all lenders. This comprehensive form captures
    all essential borrower information including personal details, employment history,
    income, assets, liabilities, and property information. The application can be
    completed online through the bank's portal, over the phone with a loan officer,
    or in person. Once submitted, the application becomes a binding document and the
    bank is required to provide a Loan Estimate within 3 business days per TRID regulations.
    This is a critical milestone that triggers the formal loan processing workflow.
  steps:
  - Customer accesses loan application portal (web or mobile)
  - Customer creates account or logs into existing account
  - Customer selects loan type (purchase, refinance, cash-out refinance)
  - 'Customer completes Section 1: Borrower Information (name, SSN, DOB, marital status,
    dependents)'
  - 'Customer completes Section 2: Financial Information (employment, income, assets)'
  - 'Customer completes Section 3: Property Information (address, property type, intended
    use)'
  - 'Customer completes Section 4: Loan Information (loan amount, down payment, loan
    purpose)'
  - 'Customer completes Section 5: Declarations (bankruptcies, foreclosures, judgments,
    etc.)'
  - Customer reviews all information for accuracy
  - Customer provides electronic signature consenting to credit pull and authorizing
    information verification
  - Customer submits application
  - System validates required fields are complete
  - System creates application record in LOS
  - System generates application confirmation number
  - System triggers Loan Estimate generation (must be sent within 3 business days
    per TRID)
  - Customer receives confirmation email with application number and next steps
  purpose: Formally initiate the mortgage loan process by capturing all required borrower
    and property information in a standardized format. The application serves as the
    foundation for all subsequent underwriting and processing activities.
  business_context: Application submission is the point where a customer transitions
    from shopping to committing to a loan with the bank. The experience must be smooth
    and professional to maintain customer confidence. The bank must balance thorough
    data collection with user experience - asking for too much upfront can cause abandonment,
    while asking for too little requires multiple follow-ups. Modern applications
    use progressive disclosure and save progress to improve completion rates. The
    application data quality directly impacts processing efficiency and underwriting
    accuracy.
  inputs:
  - Borrower personal information (name, SSN, DOB, contact info)
  - Employment information (employer name, address, phone, job title, years employed)
  - Income information (annual income, monthly income, overtime, bonuses)
  - Asset information (bank accounts, investments, real estate)
  - Liability information (credit cards, loans, alimony, child support)
  - Property information (address, purchase price, property type)
  - Loan information (loan amount, down payment, loan purpose)
  - Customer signature and consent
  outputs:
  - Completed Uniform Residential Loan Application (1003)
  - Application record in LOS
  - Application confirmation number
  - Trigger for Loan Estimate generation
  - Application submission timestamp
  prerequisites:
  - Customer must be 18 years or older
  - Customer must have valid SSN

  regulatory_context: The Uniform Residential Loan Application (1003) is required
    by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and FHA/VA guidelines. Submission triggers TRID requirements
    including mandatory Loan Estimate delivery within 3 business days. All information
    must be collected in compliance with fair lending laws and cannot discriminate
    based on protected characteristics.
  exceptions:
  - condition: Customer abandons application partway through
    action: Save progress and send reminder email. Allow customer to resume where
      they left off.

    action: Display inline validation errors and prevent submission until corrected
  - condition: Duplicate application detected (same SSN and property)
