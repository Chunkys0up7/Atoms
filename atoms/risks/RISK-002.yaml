  # Data Loss and Corruption Risks

  ## Risk 1: Database Failure Without Recovery
  **Likelihood**: Low
  **Impact**: Critical
  **Overall Risk**: HIGH

  ### Description
  Complete database failure with corrupted or missing backups.

  ### Mitigation (from DES-002, PROC-002)
  - Daily full backups with verification
  - Incremental backups every 6 hours
  - 30-day retention period
  - Weekly restore testing
  - Geographic redundancy (S3 cross-region)

  ### Residual Risk
  Low

  ### Recovery Plan
  - RTO: 4 hours
  - RPO: 6 hours
  - Restore from latest backup
  - Verify data integrity
  - Resume operations

  ## Risk 2: Neo4j Sync Failures
  **Likelihood**: Medium
  **Impact**: Medium
  **Overall Risk**: MEDIUM

  ### Description
  YAML files and Neo4j database become out of sync, causing incorrect impact analysis.

  ### Mitigation
  - Daily automated sync
  - Integrity checks after each sync
  - Dry-run mode for testing
  - Manual verification procedures

  ### Residual Risk
  Low-Medium

  ## Risk 3: Backup Corruption
  **Likelihood**: Low
  **Impact**: High
  **Overall Risk**: MEDIUM

  ### Description
  Backup files become corrupted and unrestorable.

  ### Mitigation
  - Checksum verification on backup
  - Weekly restore testing
  - Multiple backup copies
  - Backup integrity monitoring

  ### Residual Risk
  Low

  ## Risk 4: Accidental Data Deletion
  **Likelihood**: Medium
  **Impact**: Medium
  **Overall Risk**: MEDIUM

  ### Description
  User accidentally deletes critical atoms or modules.

  ### Mitigation
  - Soft delete with 30-day retention
  - Version history in Git
  - Approval workflow for deletions
  - Audit logging

  ### Residual Risk
  Low

  ## Monitoring and Alerts
  - Backup failure: Immediate PagerDuty
  - Backup age > 8 hours: Warning
  - Restore test failure: High priority
  - Sync failure: Medium priority
