  # Authentication Security Risks

  ## Risk 1: Brute Force Attacks
  **Likelihood**: High
  **Impact**: High
  **Overall Risk**: CRITICAL

  ### Description
  Attackers may attempt to brute force user passwords or API endpoints.

  ### Mitigation (from DES-001)
  - Rate limiting: 5 failed attempts per IP per 15 minutes
  - Account lockout after 10 failed attempts
  - CAPTCHA after 3 failed attempts
  - IP blocking for persistent attacks

  ### Residual Risk
  Low (with mitigations in place)

  ## Risk 2: JWT Token Theft
  **Likelihood**: Medium
  **Impact**: High
  **Overall Risk**: HIGH

  ### Description
  JWT access tokens could be stolen via XSS or man-in-the-middle attacks.

  ### Mitigation
  - Short expiry (15 minutes)
  - HTTP-only cookies for web clients
  - Secure flag on all cookies
  - SameSite=Strict attribute
  - TLS 1.3 required

  ### Residual Risk
  Low-Medium

  ## Risk 3: OAuth Provider Compromise
  **Likelihood**: Low
  **Impact**: Critical
  **Overall Risk**: HIGH

  ### Description
  If OAuth provider (Google, GitHub) is compromised, user accounts could be accessed.

  ### Mitigation
  - Multiple OAuth providers supported
  - Periodic token validation
  - Audit logging of OAuth events
  - Incident response plan

  ### Residual Risk
  Medium (dependent on third-party)

  ## Risk 4: Session Fixation
  **Likelihood**: Medium
  **Impact**: Medium
  **Overall Risk**: MEDIUM

  ### Description
  Attacker could force user to use a known session ID.

  ### Mitigation
  - Regenerate session ID on login
  - Validate session origin
  - Short session timeout

  ### Residual Risk
  Low

  ## Monitoring and Detection
  - Failed login attempts > 100/hour
  - Token validation failures > 10/minute
  - OAuth callback errors > 5/hour
  - Unusual geographic login patterns
