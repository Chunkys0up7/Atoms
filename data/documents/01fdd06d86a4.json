determination\n- Hazard insurance quotes obtained\n\n### Completeness Review\n| Item | FHA Required | Status |\n|------|-------------|--------|\n| Application (Form 1003) | Yes | Required |\n| Credit Report | Yes | Pulled in pre-app |\n| Employment Verification | Yes | Ordered if current employed |\n| Income Verification (W-2, tax returns) | Yes | Collected |\n| Asset Verification | Yes | Bank

**Modules:** income-verification + credit-analysis + property-appraisal\n\n### Key Differences from Conventional\n\n**FHA-Specific Processing:**\n\n1. **Mortgage Insurance Calculation**\n   - Upfront Mortgage Insurance Premium (UFMIP): 1.75% of loan amount\n   - Annual Mortgage Insurance Premium (MIP): Varies by LTV\n   - MIP continues for life of loan if LTV > 90% at origination\n   - MIP can be paid upfront or rolled into loan\n\n2. **Income Calculation**\n   - Use FHA net income ratios (more conservative than conventional)\n   - Front-end ratio: 40% (housing + FHA MI)\n   - Back-end ratio: 57% (total debts + FHA MI)\n   - Any income with < 2 year history questioned\n\n3. **Credit Requirements**\n   - No mortgage history < 2 years if payment trend negative\n   - 3-year seasoning for bankruptcy (with compensating factors)\n   - Deferred judgment available for credit issues if documented\n\n### Atoms in Processing Phase\n\n**Income Verification:**\n```yaml\natoms:\n  -
